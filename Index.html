        <p> The first of these places that make up who I am is Ipswich, England aka the place I was born. I only lived there for 5 years of my life but I still have tea time when I can.
            I also have dual citizenship with England in case Im feeling "homesick". The second place is Kennesaw, GA the place I was raised. From 5 until 18, I lived in Kennesaw and it is where I became
            person that I am today. Many of my best friends are still from my Kennesaw. The last place is actually a place I've only been to once but its where both my parents and my heritage come from. These 
            places together make the person I am.

<!-- Im aware of the problems with my code so here is where Im going to talk about what I think went wrong
First. I think the problem with most of the formating is that the body is formated first and I havent been able to figure out
how to overide the body css styles. I think thats why the aside and section are where they are. I thought if I floated both section
and aside to the left they would cooperate and make columns but that isnt happening. -->
